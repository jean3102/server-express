# server-express

This server was created in Express with a typescript and authentication module.

## config database

Go to the path 'src\config\envAccess.js' and add your database credentials

### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`PORT`,
`DB_HOST`,
`DB_USER`,
`DB_PASSWORD`,
`DB_NAME`,
`DB_PORT`

## To test authentication

I am using the library bcrypt for encrypt password.

To test the authentication with the database use this password:
"$2b$10$WDL.DzJlnJKRvYlcDrEqt.yOuyMpzmgJyqTCUY1o/itjy.EvfZuQO"

and send it this "123456" for return true otherwise it will return false

Request type POST:

```javascript
{
  "user": "userName",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

or encrypt your own password using this method which is in `src\controllers\AuthController.ts` line 26

```javascript
	async encryptPassword(password: string) {
		const saltRounds = 10; // The cost factor for bcrypt (higher is more secure but slower)
		return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
	}
```

## change the query to find the user

Go to the path 'src\sql\auth.ts'

## npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3030/home to view it in the browser.
